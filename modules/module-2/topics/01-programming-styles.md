# Programming Styles

Python is considered a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, procedural and functional programming styles.

This workshop won't cover the general differences between _all_ of these styles, but for more information, see:

- [Python Programming Styles](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerd-life/python-programming-styles)
- [Perceiving Python Programming Paradigms](https://opensource.com/article/19/10/python-programming-paradigms)
- [Progamming Paradigms in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/programming-paradigms-in-python/)


Instead, we'll focus on the differences between two overarching ways to structure code in Python: through functions or objects.
