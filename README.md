## Before We Get Started

### Python Version

This workshop is structured around Python 3.x and above, so make sure you're using a compatible Python version:

```py
$ python
Python 3.8.1 (tags/v3.8.1:1b293b6, Dec 18 2019, 23:11:46) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

### Tools You Will Need

In a couple places this workshop assumes your source control technology is git.

### Prompts

In some sections of the workshop, some code blocks may start with the Python interpreter prompt (`>>>`):

```py
>>> import mypy
```

Other code blocks may not.  Be on the lookout for the interpreter prompt as a signal you should enter your current Python interpreter.
