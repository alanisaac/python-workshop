## Before We Get Started

### Python Version

This workshop is structured around Python 3.x and above, so make sure you're using a compatible Python version:

```py
$ python
Python 3.8.1 (tags/v3.8.1:1b293b6, Dec 18 2019, 23:11:46) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

```

### Tools You Will Need

- Git Bash ([install](https://git-scm.com/download/win)): _on windows only_, used as the default shell in this workshop.
- Docker ([install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)): used to run a local package repository.  


### Prompts

In some sections of the workshop, some code blocks may start with the Python interpreter prompt (`>>>`):

```py
>>> import mypy
```

Other code blocks may not.  Be on the lookout for the interpreter prompt as a signal you should enter your current Python interpreter.
